abstract: Data management for neuroscience. An introduction to BIDS and DataLad.
  What is it, why should I care, and how can I use it?
  This talk was presented as a two hour introduction to graduate students of the
  International Research Training Group 2150 Aachen. It covers two topics relevant
  to state-of-the art data management in neuroscience -- The BIDS standard, and
  DataLad.
  The slides are available on GitHub and linked above. They contain useful links
  to BIDS-related tools, and explanations on the basics of DataLad (local version
  control, reproducible execution and provenance capture).
