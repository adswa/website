After graduating with a M.Sc in Psychology in 2019,
I'm now a doctoral researcher at the Juelich Research Centre,
[INM-7](https://www.fz-juelich.de/inm/inm-7/EN/Home/home_node.html),
in the [Psychoinformatics Lab](https://www.psychoinformatics.de/).

My research focus lies on open source software development to foster open
and reproducible scientific practices and analyses in neuroscience.

I have acquired a broad potpourri of skills over the course of my studies.
In previous employments and internships, I acquired experience in neuropsychological
assessments, primarily with dementia patients, in experimental and comparative psychology,
working with different species of corvids, and in teaching, as a teaching assistant for statistics.
Now, however, I have found my passion in psychoinformatics.
