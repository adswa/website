The handbook is a practical, hands-on crash-course to learn and experience DataLad
(https://www.datalad.org).
It is free and open-source, collaboratively developed, and written for scientists
and users (not developers). One does not need to be a programmer, computer scientist, or Linux-crank
to use it -- regardless of background and personal use cases for DataLad,
the handbook teaches the principles of DataLad.
