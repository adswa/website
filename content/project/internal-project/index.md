multimatch-gazeis a Python-based reimplementation of the MultiMatch toolbox for
scanpath comparison, originally developed by Jarodzka, Holmqvist, & Nystr√∂m (2010)
and im-plemented by Dewhurst et al. (2012) in Matlab.

This reimplementation in Python aims at providing an accessible, documented, and
testedopen source alternative to the existing MultiMatch toolbox. The algorithm
is an establishedtool for scan path comparison (N. C. Anderson, Anderson, Kingstone,
& Bischof, 2015),and improved availability aids adoption in a broader research community.
multimatch-gaze is available from its Github repository and as the Python package
multimatch-gaze via pip.
