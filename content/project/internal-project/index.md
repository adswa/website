`multimatch-gaze` is a Python-based reimplementation of the MultiMatch toolbox for
scanpath comparison, originally developed by Jarodzka, Holmqvist, & Nystr√∂m (2010)
and implemented by Dewhurst et al. (2012) in Matlab.

This reimplementation in Python aims at providing an accessible, documented, and
tested open source alternative to the existing MultiMatch toolbox.
`multimatch-gaze` is available from its Github repository and as the Python package
`multimatch-gaze` via `pip`.
